# WA Project - Backend

- API created using Node JS with Typescript, Mongo DB, and Express. 

- The tests in the endpoint were created with jest and supertest.

- The API Documentation was created using Swagger UI.

- You will need the environment variables to run the API, please contact me.

- To run the api using docker, use the command in the docker-dev archive, this will create the containers for the api.

- The database, MongoDB, is in a free cluster and we dont need to create a container in docker for it.

- If you want to run the api locally without Docker, use yarn dev command.

- To checkout the API Documentation locally, access http://localhost:3333/swagger 

- To run the tests, use yarn test
