#API created using Node JS, Typeorm (latest) and Express.

#To run the api using docker, use the command in the docker-dev archive, this will create the containers for the api, the database (Postgres) and the pgadmin.

#To only run locally, use yarn dev, and comment the line 24 in the server.ts, which will not connect to the database.
